tagline: A Git-compatible VCS that is both simple and powerful
about: |
  Jujutsu is a powerful version control system for software projects. 
  You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use. 
  It is designed from the ground up to be easy to useâ€”whether you're new or experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software projects with large histories and teams.
