tagline: Just a command runner
about: |
  just is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands.
  Commands, called recipes, are stored in a file called justfile with syntax inspired by make
  just has a ton of useful features, and many improvements over make:
  - just is a command runner, not a build system, so it avoids much of make's complexity and idiosyncrasies. No need for .PHONY recipes!
  - Linux, MacOS, and Windows are supported with no additional dependencies. (Although if your system doesn't have an sh, you'll need to choose a different shell.)
  - Errors are specific and informative, and syntax errors are reported along with their source context.
  - Recipes can accept command line arguments.
  - Wherever possible, errors are resolved statically. Unknown recipes and circular dependencies are reported before anything runs.
  - just loads .env files, making it easy to populate environment variables.
  - Recipes can be listed from the command line.
  - Command line completion scripts are available for most popular shells.
  - Recipes can be written in arbitrary languages, like Python or NodeJS.
  - just can be invoked from any subdirectory, not just the directory that contains the justfile.
