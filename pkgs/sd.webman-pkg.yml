tagline: Intuitive find & replace CLI (sed alternative)
about: |
  sd is an intuitive find & replace CLI.
  Painless regular expressions
  sd uses regex syntax that you already know from JavaScript and Python. Forget about dealing with quirks of sed or awk - get productive immediately.
  String-literal mode
  Non-regex find & replace. No more backslashes or remembering which characters are special and need to be escaped.
  Easy to read, easy to write
  Find & replace expressions are split up, which makes them easy to read and write. No more messing with unclosed and escaped slashes.
  Smart, common-sense defaults
  Defaults follow common sense and are tailored for typical daily use.
