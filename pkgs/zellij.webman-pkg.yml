tagline: A terminal workspace with batteries included
about: |
  Zellij is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal. 
  At its core, it is a terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux and screen), but this is merely its infrastructure layer.
  Zellij includes a layout system, and a plugin system allowing one to create plugins in any language that compiles to WebAssembly.
