tagline: A more intuitive version of du in rust
about: |
  Dust is meant to give you an instant overview of which directories are using disk space without requiring sort or head. 
  Dust will print a maximum of one 'Did not have permissions message'.
  Dust will list a slightly-less-than-the-terminal-height number of the biggest subdirectories or files and will smartly recurse down the tree to find the larger ones. 
  There is no need for a '-d' flag or a '-h' flag. The largest subdirectories will be colored.
  
  The different colors on the bars: These represent the combined tree hierarchy & disk usage. 
  The shades of grey are used to indicate which parent folder a subfolder belongs to. 
  For instance, look at the above screenshot. .steam is a folder taking 44% of the space. 
  From the .steam bar is a light grey line that goes up. 
  All these folders are inside .steam so if you delete .steam all that stuff will be gone too.
