tagline: A command-line tool and library for generating regular expressions from user-provided test cases.
about: |
  grex is a library as well as a command-line utility that is meant to 
  simplify the often complicated and tedious task of creating regular 
  expressions. It does so by automatically generating a single regular 
  expression from user-provided test cases. The resulting expression 
  is guaranteed to match the test cases which it was generated from. 
  It generate the most specific regular expression possible by default 
  which exactly matches the given input only and nothing else.
