tagline: Command-line JSON processor
about: |
  jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
  If you want to learn to use jq, read the documentation at https://stedolan.github.io/jq. 
  This documentation is generated from the docs/ folder of this repository. You can also try it online at jqplay.org.
  If you want to hack on jq, feel free, but be warned that its internals are not well-documented at the moment. 
  Bring a hard hat and a shovel. 
  Also, read the wiki: https://github.com/stedolan/jq/wiki, where you will find cookbooks, discussion of advanced topics, internals, release engineering, and more.
