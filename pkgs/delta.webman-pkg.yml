tagline: A viewer for git and diff output
about: |
  A syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output.
  Code evolves, and we all spend time studying diffs. 
  Delta aims to make this both efficient and enjoyable: 
  it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output.
