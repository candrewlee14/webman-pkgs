about: |
  Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.
  Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge.
    ~ No hidden control flow.
    ~ No hidden memory allocations.
    ~ No preprocessor, no macros.
  A fresh approach to metaprogramming based on compile-time code execution and lazy evaluation.
    ~ Call any function at compile-time.
    ~ Manipulate types as values without runtime overhead.
    ~ Comptime emulates the target architecture.
  Incrementally improve your C/C++/Zig codebase.
    ~ Use Zig as a zero-dependency, drop-in C/C++ compiler that supports cross-compilation out-of-the-box.
    ~ Leverage zig build to create a consistent development environment across all platforms.
    ~ Add a Zig compilation unit to C/C++ projects; cross-language LTO is enabled by default.
